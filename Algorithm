1. This algorithm serves multiple requests in parallel and reduces waiting time.

2. Dividing 200 floors to 10 different zones and each zone is operated with 5 elevators each.

3. If we consider elevator is at ground floor in zone-1(1-20 floors), 
the elevator will move all the way upside, serving all the requests that come in its way.

4. Only once it reaches the top floor, the elevator will change its direction, 
moving all the way to the last floor, serving all the requests that come in its way.

5. For this approach, the elevator scans for a request at every floor while moving up and down. 

Ex: The elevator starts at floor 3 and finds a request at floor 5 and 9 when moving up. 
It stops at these floors, picks the passenger and continues moving up. 
Only at the last floor, i.e., floor 10, the elevator will change direction and start moving down. 
It will drop the two passengers it has picked at their destination floor as soon as it comes in the elevatorâ€™s path. 
While moving down, the elevator checks at every floor and finds a request at floors 4 and 2. 
It picks the passengers as it reaches their floors and drops them as soon as their destination comes in its path.

6. Since, 5 elevators are considered for 20 floors, then if elevator-1 starts from ground position moving up,
elevator-2 will be moving down from 20th floor. Similarly other elevators are moved alternatively.

7. During peak hours if elevators are moved in a pattern like if elevators goes in a sequence when elevator-1 at 4th floor, 
elevator-2 at 8th and so on moving up and one elevator at ground to pick up passengers then it will reduce waiitng time 
during peak hours.

8. some elevators should be allocated for emergency alarms, VIP persons etc.
